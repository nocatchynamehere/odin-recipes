Overview
This is a beginner-level HTML project built as part of the Foundations curriculum from The Odin Project. The goal is to create a simple, multi-page recipe website using only basic HTML. This project is an early step toward understanding how to structure and build functional websites from scratch.

Features
Home page with links to individual recipe pages

Multiple recipes, each on its own HTML page

Skills Gained
Through this project, I‚Äôve gained hands-on experience with:

Writing semantic, accessible HTML

Structuring multi-page sites using internal links

Embedding images with ethical sourcing and accessibility in mind

Using Git for version control and pushing changes to GitHub

What's Next?
This site will serve as a base for future modules in The Odin Project, where I will:

Add styling with CSS
